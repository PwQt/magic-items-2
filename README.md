This module for Foundry VTT and specific for the **DnD5e system**, adds the ability to create magical items with spells or feats that belong to the item itself, such as staffs or 
magic wands, which will be automatically inherited from the character who owns the item.

## Usage Instructions

1) Once activated, a new tab named 'Magic Item' will be available for each items of type 'weapon', 'equipment' or 'consumable'.  
2) In this tab, you can drag spells from a compendium and configure its consumption which will be subtracted from the total number of charges each time the spell is used.  
3) It is also possible to configure the max number of charges, if they can be can be recharged and when, and if the item will be destroyed when the charges reach 0.

</div>

Using combinations of these parameters is possible to create, for example:

* A legendary staff equipped with great thaumaturgical spells

<div align="center">

![example1](/wiki/example1.png?raw=true)
</div>

* A globe with a perennial light spell.

</div>

* A scroll with a powerful necromantic spell that dissolves once pronounced.

</div>

In addition to spells, it is also possible to assign feats to the items, or combinations of both:

</div>

When a character is equipped with one or more magical objects, within his sheet in the spellbook/features section, 
a set of inherited spells/feats divided by item will be displayed after his owned items:

<div align="center">

![example4](/wiki/example4.png?raw=true)
</div>

<div align="center">

![example6](/wiki/example6.png?raw=true)
</div>

From here you can cast spells or use feats provided by the items and monitor the consumption/recharges.

You can move the Display of the Spells/Feats up to the top of the sheet in settings.
